# 💼 Sanju Pokharel - Resume Portfolio Website

This is a **minimal, resume-style portfolio website** made with only HTML and CSS. It’s styled like a code editor (dark theme), keeping things clean, readable, and developer-friendly. It also includes a **downloadable PDF resume** button.

## 🛠 What I Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling (using `:root` variables for theme)
- **Fira Code** font for a developer-code feel
- No frameworks or libraries — just clean and simple code

## 📁 How to Use
